# SG.2.01 - Information Security Program Content



### Control Statement

The IllumiDesk Security Department Leadership conducts a monthly staff meeting to communicate and align on relevant security threats, program performance, and resource prioritization.

###  Context

By holding meetings to communicate information about the security program and relevant security threats, IllumiDesk team-members can better understand IllumiDesk's overall security posture, future initiatives, and the threat landscape. Such meetings also afford an opportunity to engage with and learn more about security, the benefits of which can extend outside the security department and bring value to customers and partners.

###  Scope

TBD

###  Ownership

IllumiDesk's Director of Security
