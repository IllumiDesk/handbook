# IAM.1.05 - Transfers: Access De-Provisioning



### Control Statement

Upon notification of a reassignment or transfer, management reviews the GitLab team member's access for appropriateness. Access that is no longer required is revoked and documented, and any shared authentication credentials to which the team member had access are rotated.

###  Context

The purpose of this control is to ensure there is a process in place to remove access to user accounts that is no longer necessary in the event of a role change. This control helps ensure that only authorized and active accounts can be accessed and used to prevent any unauthorized use or access of IllumiDesk customer, IllumiDesk teammember, and partner data. PeopleOperations would be responsible for advising of role change and new hiring manager of reviewing and de-provisioning any access that was no longer required.

###  Scope

This control applies to any system or service where user accounts can be provisioned.
