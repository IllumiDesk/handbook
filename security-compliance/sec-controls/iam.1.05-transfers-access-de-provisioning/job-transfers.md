# Job Transfers

* An access review should be documented and performed as part of a formal job transfer. The review should be perfomed by the new manager of the team member who is transferring to a new role.
* Upon notification of a reassignment or transfer, management reviews the IllumiDesker's access for appropriateness. Access that is no longer required is revoked and documented.
