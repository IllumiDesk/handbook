# Logical Access Deprovisioning



* In the case of a separation from the company, all access will be deprovisioned within 3 business days from the date on which the offboarding request is submitted unless otherwise specified.
* All attempts will be made for individual access removal requests to be processed within the SLA requested. If no SLA is noted, access will be deprovisioned within 3 business days of the submission of the issue.
* If access removal needs to occur immediately, please follow the panic email procedures, which will alert the Security Team on-call.
