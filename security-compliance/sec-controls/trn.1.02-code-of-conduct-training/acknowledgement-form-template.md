# Acknowledgement form template

### Code of Business Conduct & Ethics Acknowledgment Form <a id="code-of-business-conduct--ethics-acknowledgment-form"></a>

Team members will review and sign the Code of Business Conduct & Ethics Acknowledgment Form during onboarding as well as annually during the Global Compensation Annual Review cycle. Please access the form template by clicking here.

During the annual merit cycle, people operations will be responsible for sending all team members the updated Code of Business Conduct & Ethics acknowledgment form and ensuring all team members review and acknowledge. The Code of Conduct will be sent to each team member via BambooHR. To review and sign the document: log into BambooHR download the PDF and click on the Code of Conduct Link. Once a team member has reviewed the Code of Conduct they will use the BambooHR signature and date tool to complete the acknowledgement. No changes should be made to the Code of Business Conduct & Ethics without prior approval from the VP of Legal.

Team members that joined prior to the established requirement to upload the acknowledgement at hire are the exception but will be subject to capturing their acknowledgement during annual reviews.

### IllumiDesk People Policy Directory <a id="gitlab-people-policy-directory"></a>

All of the policies listed below are important for IllumiDesk team-members to read and understand as they deal with people benefits, procedures, and requirements of the company. If you have any questions around the internal policies, please reach out to People Operations.

#### Sick Time - Taking and Reporting <a id="sick-time---taking-and-reporting"></a>

In keeping with our values of freedom, efficiency, transparency, kindness, and boring solutions, we have crafted the following protocol around sick leave for all IllumiDesk team-members.

**All IllumiDesk team-members**

If you or a loved one is ill, we want you to take care of yourself or your loved one\(s\). To facilitate this, you should take sick leave when you need it. Sick leave is meant to be used when you are ill, or to care for family members including your parent\(s\), child\(ren\), spouse, registered domestic partner, grandparent\(s\), grandchild\(ren\), or sibling\(s\).

You still need to report when you take sick leave, by entering the dates as an event in PTO Ninja via Slack. Once entered in PTO Ninja it will automatically update in BambooHR and payroll can update any other systems.

If you need sick leave for more than 8 consecutive calendar days, notify your manager and the Total Rewards Analyst team \(aka Total Rewards\) to accommodate an extended leave request. What can \(or must\) be accommodated varies from location to location: IllumiDesk will comply with the applicable laws in your specific location.

Upon request, you should be able to provide proper documentation of the reason for your sick leave \(doctor's note\).

**Details for specific groups of IllumiDesk team-members**

Employees of IllumiDesk Inc. can take off sick time in line with our paid time off policy. Sick time does not get paid out in case of termination, nor does it reduce your final paycheck in case of a negative balance. Related to the topic of extended leave requests, see information about short term disability through UHC / your state.

Employees of IllumiDesk have further rights and responsibilities regarding sick time based on Dutch law, as written into their employment contracts:

* Once People Operations has been notified of the sickness they will also inform HR.
* If an employee is sick, People Operations will inform HRSavvy and they will be registered in their HR portal from the first day of sickness.
* If the employee is then on long-term sick leave \(1 working week or more\), People Operations will instruct HR to register the employee at the occupational health and safety service, depending on the situation and agreement with the employee.

#### Worker's Compensation <a id="workers-compensation"></a>

If you have been injured at work, please contact Total Rewards Analysts to determine what your benefits are.

#### Military Leave <a id="military-leave"></a>

IllumiDesk is committed to protecting the rights of team members absent on military leave. No team member or prospective team member will be subjected to any form of discrimination on the basis of membership in or obligation to perform service for any of the uniformed services of their country of residency. If any team member believes that he or she has been subjected to discrimination in violation of this policy, immediately contact People Business Partners for assistance. For any questions about how to initiate a military leave, please contact People Operations.

#### Hiring Significant Others or Family Members <a id="hiring-significant-others-or-family-members"></a>

IllumiDesk is committed to a policy of employment and advancement based on **qualifications and merit** and does not discriminate in favor of or in opposition to the employment of significant others or relatives. Due to the potential for perceived or actual conflicts, such as favoritism or personal conflicts from outside the work environment, which can be carried into the daily working relationship, IllumiDesk will hire or consider other employment actions concerning significant others and/or relatives of persons currently employed or contracted only if **all** points below are true:

* Candidates for employment will not be working directly for or supervising a significant other or relative.
* Candidates for employment will not occupy a position in the same line of authority in which employees can initiate or participate in decisions involving a direct benefit to the significant other or relative. Such decisions include hiring, retention, transfer, promotion, wages, and leave requests.

This policy applies to all current employees and candidates for employment. In the spirit of our Transparency value, we ask the team member and the candidate to disclose the family relationship to the recruiter at the beginning of the hiring process. If the candidate progresses through the process as a final candidate, and prior to any offer, the recruiter should notify the hiring manager and the People Business Partner of the family relationship to ensure there is not a conflict of interest. In addition, the IllumiDesk team member should not be part of their family member's interview process.

#### Relocation <a id="relocation"></a>

If your permanent address is changing, notify the Total Rewards Analyst at total-rewards@ domain of the new address before the pay cycle of the move. The best way to do this is by logging in to BambooHR and changing your address under the **Personal** tab which triggers a message to the BambooHR admin to review the change and "accept" it. If you do not have your new address you can also email People Operations to trigger a review.

* The Total Rewards Analyst will also update the locality field in BambooHR \(if applicable\), Payroll, and the Compensation Calculator with the change.
* If you are changing from one entity to another, the Total Rewards Analyst will list you as terminated on the appropriate payroll changes file for the current entity and add you as a new hire in the appropriate payroll changes file for the new entity.
  * They will also change your benefit group in BambooHR to INELIGIBLE and send an email to Lumity with the termination date and coverages to be terminated if you are moving out of the US. They will place you in the appropriate benefit group in BambooHR and send an email to Lumity with your relocation date if you are moving into the US.

If you are going to spend six months or more in one location this will be considered as a relocation and your compensation will be evaluated based on the new geo area.

* If your relocation is to a different geo area, then to stay aligned with our compensation principles and per the standard contract agreements, you should obtain written agreement first from your manager \(email will do\) and then from the Total Rewards Analyst team \(aka Total Rewards\). You must have approval 30 days prior to any official move. If you are considering a move it is best to discuss this with your manager as soon as possible, before you have actually moved, to understand the impact to compensation or your role at IllumiDesk. In almost all situations the compensation may change. In some instances a move will not align to your proposed location, \(e.g. a recruiter hired in EMEA to support EMEA would not be approved to move to the US\). It is the company's discretion to offer you a contract in your new location or to not continue with your contract based on a relocation. For an idea about the impact please check with our Compensation & Benefits Manager, Brittany Rohde, for an accurate salary in the new geographical area.
* To initiate a request for relocation the team member or manager can reach out to their assigned People Business Partner \(PBP\). The PBP will work with the Total Rewards team to review the request and any changes in compensation.
* If a team member is moving to a location with a lower or equivalent location factor, the change only needs to be approved by their manager and the assigned People Business Partner. If the team member is moving to a location with a higher location factor they will need their People Business Partner and their group Executives approval.
* Once approved the PBP will confirm the relocation with the Total Rewards team.
* The Total Rewards Analyst team will check that any necessary changes to payroll and benefits administration are processed in time.
* The Total Rewards Analyst team will generate a letter of adjustment confirming the changes.
* This letter is drafted by the Total Rewards Analysts and signed by the Compensation & Benefits Manager and the signed document is filed in BambooHR.
* If there are any questions or concerns, please reach out to your People Business Partner.

If there are any questions or concerns, please reach out to the Chief People Officer.

**Short-term relocation**

If you are not changing your permanent location \(where you pay taxes and maintain residency\), but instead are traveling to different locations over a period of time, you are responsible for maintaining your health insurance, visas, and any other item directly relating to your travel. Since IllumiDesk does not require you to travel to these locations as part of your position, you will not be eligible to utilize the Business Accident Travel Policy or expense any items related to your travel. If you are hired in a role requiring a timezone alignment, you must still be able to fulfill that requirement.

#### Tuition Reimbursement <a id="tuition-reimbursement"></a>

IllumiDesk supports team members who wish to continue their education and growth within their professional career. If you are a full-time IllumiDesk team member and have been employed for more than three months, you are eligible to participate in this program. To be eligible for reimbursement, courses must be a requirement of a degree or certification program and delivered through a credentialed college or university or effective online education such as Udacity.

IllumiDesk team-members are eligible for a reimbursement of up to 20,000 USD per calendar year \(January 1st - December 31st\) depending on tenure, performance, and company need for the learned skill. A course is considered to be included in the calendar year in which the course is paid/reimbursed \(which should also be the same calendar year in which the course ends\). Approval must be obtained in advance from the e-group member in charge of your organization and in accordance with the signature authorization policy. There is no limit to the number of years a team member can participate in the program. Courses eligible for reimbursement include classes for credit resulting in a grade \(not pass/fail\), courses providing continuing education credits, and/or courses taken as part of a certification program. You must earn a passing grade equivalent to a “B” or obtain a successful completion certification to submit for reimbursement.

The program will cover only the tuition and enrollment related fees. Additional fees related to parking, books, supplies, technology, or administrative charges are not covered as part of the program. Tuition will be validated by receipt showing proof of payment. A description of the course\(s\) and degree or certification program along with a final grade report or satisfactory certificate of completion are required to receive reimbursement.

If you voluntarily terminate employment with IllumiDesk after completion of the course and prior to completing twelve consecutive months of active employment after completion of the course, you will refund the entire amount of the educational expenses provided to you.

Examples of requests that may be approved:

* A Backend Engineer who is not on a performance improvement plan seeking a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
* A People Operations Generalist seeking a master's in Human Resources with a concentration in International Employee Relations.
* A Security Analyst seeking to take courses to gain a Cybersecurity certificate through an accredited college or university.
* A Product Marketing Manager seeking to take courses to become a Certified Brand Manager from The Association of International Product Marketing and Management.
* A Technical Account Manager seeking to obtain a Cloud Certification such as CompTIA Cloud, AWS Certified Solutions Architect, MicroSoft MCSA/MCSE, Cisco CCNA/CCNP.

Examples of requests that may be denied:

* A Marketing Manager seeking a master's in Human Resources, but has no intention of applying to a role in people ops.
* A Frontend Engineer seeking a master's in computer science who is on a performance improvement plan or having discussions around underperformance.

**Tuition Reimbursement Process**

To receive tuition reimbursement, IllumiDesk team members should follow the following process:

1. IllumiDesk team member first discusses their interest in professional development with their manager.
2. If the manager agrees that the degree or certification program is aligned with the business and growth opportunities within IllumiDesk, a minimum of three weeks prior to the course start date, the IllumiDesk team member fills out a Tuition Reimbursement Agreement and forwards it to the Total Rewards Analyst team at total-rewards@ domain to stage for the proper signatures \(IllumiDesk team member, Manager, People Operations\) in HelloSign.
3. The Total Rewards Analyst will confirm there are no additional tax implications for reimbursement in the team member's country.
4. The Total Rewards Analyst will file the application and signed agreement in BambooHR.
5. The Total Rewards Analyst will also log the tuition reimbursement in the "Tuition Reimbursement Log" found on the Google Drive.
6. Once the course is completed, an official grade report or successful certification of completion must be submitted to People Operations.
7. After grades are verified, People Operations will ensure the reimbursement is processed through the applicable payroll by the second pay cycle after submission.
   * If the program does not allow for tuition deferment and this would cause financial strain on the team member, they can email the Total Rewards Analyst at total-rewards@domain to receive 50% of the reimbursement up front and the other 50% upon successful completion of the course.

**Tax Implications for Tuition Reimbursement by Country**

In some countries, tuition reimbursement may be considered as taxable income and can be \(partially\) exempted from personal income taxes or subject to employer withholding taxes. Please contact Payroll or People Ops when you have questions.

#### Employee Safety <a id="employee-safety"></a>

**Preventing Unsafe Situations**

While IllumiDesk is 100% remote, there may be times when employees travel for work related functions or co-working events. IllumiDesk is committed to the value of a safe, violence-free work environment and ensuring and exhibiting equal commitment to the safety and health of employees.

In general, please consider the following recommendations to ensure safety when traveling or coworking:

1. Do the research. Have some familiarity with the destination before you arrive. Check with your country's government department that provides advice for traveling overseas:
   * United States citizens: check the State Department's website for country updates and enroll in a Traveler Program such as Smart Traveler Enrollment Program \(STEP\) https://step.state.gov/step/.
   * New Zealand citizens: https://safetravel.govt.nz/.
2. Try not to draw attention. People who appear to be from out of town are more vulnerable to crimes. Try to respect the culture you are visiting by blending in. Consider protective clothing to avoid pickpockets or other theft. Do not flash money or credit cards unnecessarily.
3. Make copies of important documents. Consider carrying hard copies of important documents \(passport, driver's license\) in a separate location in the event your documents are misplaced or stolen.
4. Keep friends and family updated. No matter whether you’re going on an overnight jaunt or a week-long international journey, it’s always a good idea to let friends or family know your plans. Before you leave, send a copy of your itinerary to a few trusted people who can keep tabs on your whereabouts. Check in regularly with your contacts so they know you’re where you’re supposed to be.
5. Be wary of public Wi-Fi. Be aware that hackers can steal sensitive information in the public forum. Use a VPN or other secure access if you plan to access sensitive data. More information on VPN usage in IllumiDesk.
6. Safeguard your hotel. Lock and deadbolt the door while you are in the room. Ensure the door is locked when you leave. Keep the windows closed. Try to give the impression that you’re in your room even when you’re away, such as placing the Do Not Disturb sign on the outside of your door and keeping the blinds or windows closed. Don’t let any strangers into your room, even if they say they work for the hotel. You can always call the front desk to check whether someone was ordered by hotel staff to come to your room.
7. Be aware of your surroundings. Always keep an eye on your personal belongings and use good judgment when talking to strangers. A big part of the joy of traveling is the opportunities it affords to meet new people and learn about their cultures. But if someone near you is acting suspiciously, or if you feel uncomfortable, leave the area immediately. Trust your instincts.
8. Adhere to any recommended safety recommendations made by the IllumiDesk group. For all large self-hosted events we \(jointly completed by our internal security team and our contracted security agency\) will do a full risk assessment before we converge. It will be up to employees to read said risk assessment and adhere to recommendations outlined.
9. If you are sick please do not come or participate in person workplace activities. This is for your safety and for others.

**Measures IllumiDesk Takes to Aid Employee Health and Safety**

1. Hand sanitizers placed around venue of live events or attendees given hand sanitizer.
2. Employees can expense masks for travelling if suggested in risk assessment outlined above.
3. Sick employees should expense mask if flying.
4. If health risk is considered high, all food to be served by food health professionals rather than team.
5. Fist bumps over handshakes.
6. Sick/ Contagious employees may not participate in team food preparation activities.

**Responding to Unsafe Situations:**

The following are IllumiDesk's procedures in the event an employee feels threatened or unsafe:

1. If at any point, an employee feels that they are in danger of physical harm, please contact the local authorities immediately. Local law enforcement can act quickly to protect the individual and neutralize any threats.
2. If at any point an employee feels like they or another employee may require immediate medical assistance, please contact the local authorities.
3. Once the immediate threat is controlled, employees should report any safety concerns to People Ops.
4. If you believe that a certain location, event or area presents greater risk or exposure to individuals, please notify People Ops. People Ops can proactively communicate the concerns to other \[potentially\] affected employees.
5. If at any point you believe you, personally, may commit an unsafe act, People Ops can assist in providing information about available Employee Assistance Options.

#### Mental Health Awareness <a id="mental-health-awareness"></a>

The World Health Organization \(WHO\) defines health as:

* "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition."

The WHO defines **mental health** as:

* “a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.”

Defining the terms from the sentence above:

* _"A state of well-being"_ is a self-reported measure of 'wellness'.
* _"The individual realizes his or her own abilities"_ requires feedback, positive or negative.
* _"Can cope with the normal stresses of life"_ i.e. does not find normal life overwhelming too much of the time.
* _"Can work productively and fruitfully"_ here IllumiDesk clearly has a role to play as it can provide an opportunity for productive and fruitful work.
* _"Is able to make a contribution to his or her community"_ versus the inverse, which is only being able to draw from that community.

1. Why is awareness of Mental Health important at IllumiDesk?
   * It can affect any and all of us. The statistics from the WHO are that 1 in 4 of us will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in our life. That said, we are all subject to periods where we or those around us find the "the normal stresses of life" harder than usual to deal with.
   * The more we are aware of mental health, the more inclusive we are. That will help encourage any colleagues currently experiencing mental health issues to talk about it.
   * Our business at its core is a group of people working together towards a common goal. With awareness of what might affect our colleagues, we are better equipped to help them if they do discuss it with us and therefore help our business.
   * Mental health has so much emotional baggage as a topic that it can initially seem scary to talk about. Promoting mental health awareness helps to remove the stigma and taboos associated with it.
   * IllumiDesk can offer "productive and fruitful" work for all of our employees. That should not be underestimated.
   * In the cold-light of business metrics, the healthier we are, the more productive we are.
2. At IllumiDesk we strive to create a stigma-free workplace. In accordance with the National Mental Health Association and the National Council for Behavioral Health we would like to:
   * Educate employees about the signs and symptoms of mental health disorders.
   * Encourage employees to talk about stress, workload, family commitments, and other issues.
   * Communicate that mental illnesses are real, common, and treatable.
   * Discourage stigmatizing language, including hurtful labels such as “crazy,” “loony” or “nuts.”
   * Help employees transition back to work after they take leave.
   * Encourage consultation with our employee assistance programs.
3. What are we doing to get there?
   * People Operations Learning and Development team will be developing training for managers on this topic.
   * Talk about mental health issues and ideas in the \#mental\_health\_aware Slack channel.
   * IllumiDesk would also like to encourage IllumiDesk team-members to take their time off to properly take care of themselves. We encourage the team to go to yoga, take a long lunch, or anything else in their day to day life that assists in their mental and emotional well-being.
   * In addition to our current EAP programs available for employees, we encourage IllumiDesk team-members to take a look at Working Through It for insight into reclaiming well-being at work, off work, and return to work.
   * We believe that our values and culture lends itself to being able to discuss mental health open and honestly without being stigmatized, but let's work together to make it even more inclusive. For example, Finding the right words:
     * "How can we help you do your job?"
     * "You’re not your usual self."
     * "Do you want to talk about it?"
     * "It's always OK to ask for help."
     * "It’s hard for me to understand exactly what you’re going through, but I can see that it’s distressing for you."

Any questions or concerns? Please feel free to speak with anyone in People Ops.

#### Background Checks <a id="background-checks"></a>

IllumiDesk is concerned about the safety of its team members and about maintaining appropriate controls to ensure that assets of IllumiDesk and our customer relationships and information are protected. To reduce these risks, IllumiDesk will obtain and review background information of covered prospective, and, as applicable, current employees.

IllumiDesk has contracted with Sterling Talent Solutions to perform these background checks, which will cover criminal history for the last 7 years and employment history for the last 5 years and/or the three most recent employers. IllumiDesk may use the returned background check information to make decisions regarding employment. For certain positions where the candidates financial history is relevant to the position, we may also run a check in the federal database for any financial related offenses.

All candidates who make it to the offer stage with IllumiDesk must undergo a background screening according to this policy as part of the employment screening process. All contracts will state that employment is subject to obtaining results from an approved background screening that are satisfactory to IllumiDesk. If a candidate is unwilling to follow this process we are unable to proceed with their candidacy for any position at IllumiDesk. In the event the background check is not available at the time of hire \(switching vendors or delays in processing\), IllumiDesk will run the background check as soon as possible. The same adjudication guidelines will apply to current employees as they do with prospective employees.

The Candidate Experience Specialists will initiate all background screenings for candidates. Background check results will be received by the Candidate Experience Specialist and brought to the relevant People Business Partner and functional leader to determine if the results warrant any adverse action, which could include rescinding of the offer or termination of employment.

**Disclosure and Authorization**

Candidates \(as applicable, employees\) will receive an email to fill out the background check application. The application will ask for personal and professional information. The application process includes signing a disclosure and a consent form which explains the rights of an individual undergoing a background examination. The application process is designed to take less than fifteen minutes to complete.

To prepare for the employment verification, candidates should gather each previous employer's name and address, position title held, employment start and end dates, manager’s name and title, their phone number, and email address. Details for a Human Resources contact can be entered instead of a manager's contact details.

Occasionally, Sterling will reach out to the candidate to retrieve additional information, such as backup documentation to act as proof of previous employment or picture IDs. Proof of employment can typically be provided in various ways, such as tax returns \(e.g. W2s\), pay stubs, LLC documentation, official company registrations, etc.

Background checks will act as an additional mechanism of transparency and will help to build trust with our clients.

**Review Criteria**

Once the background check is completed, Candidate Experience Specialists will review the report and determine if any negative information has a direct connection with an applicant’s ability to fulfill the job duties with competence and integrity. Criminal convictions that would raise a concern are job-related offenses, including but not limited to: embezzlement, extortion, computer/internet crime, fraud, tax evasion, and violent crimes. In addition, the report should be reviewed for omissions or inaccuracies contained in the employment application or made during the interview process.

**Fair Credit Reporting Act \(FCRA\) and Related State Law Compliance**

**Step 1: Disclosure and Authorization**

The applicant must give the employer consent to have a third party service conduct a background check. The Disclosure and Authorization form can be presented to the applicant at the time they complete the employment application form. The form should grant the employer permission to conduct an initial background check \(and, subject to state law, subsequent background checks if the applicant is hired\) utilizing a third party service. Also, a “Summary Of Your Rights Under The Fair Credit Reporting Act” should be enclosed with the consent and disclosure form. For New York applicants, a copy of Article 23-A of the Correctional Law also should be enclosed and any other relevant state summary of rights.

The background investigation cannot be lawfully conducted without a signed Disclosure and Authorization form. Applicants can be advised that they will not be considered for employment without submitting the signed form. Equally for current team members, they can be advised that their employment may be impacted if they do not consent to the background check.

**Step 2: Pre-Adverse Action: Notify the Applicant of Negative Report BEFORE Adverse Action is taken**

If the consumer reporting agency reports information which may be used, in whole or in part, as a basis for an adverse employment action \(e.g., rescinding a conditional offer of employment\), the applicant must receive notification before a final decision is made to deny employment. As a result, the employer must provide a copy of the consumer report, a pre-adverse action letter, and another copy of the FCRA notice of rights \(and for New York applicants, the Article 23-A notice\). The applicant shall also receive any applicable state rights as required.

If the disqualification decision is not based on a misrepresentation or omission in the employment application, it is a best practice to discuss the potentially disqualifying information with the individual prior to issuing the pre-adverse action notice. This practice supports the individual job-related nature of any disqualification decision.

**Step 3: Wait for a Reasonable Period of Time to Find Out What, if Any, Explanation is Offered by the Applicant**

If the applicant does not respond at all to the notification within a reasonable period of time \(5 days\), the employer may proceed with its decision to rescind the conditional offer. If the applicant responds, the employer should carefully consider the information submitted and then make a decision. If the explanation is reasonable under the circumstances, then it may still be possible to go forward with the new hire \(for example, a case of mistaken identity\). However, if the applicant's explanation is determined to be insufficient, then the employer should proceed to the next step.

**Step 4: Notify Applicant of Adverse Action**

The employer must provide the applicant with written notice of the adverse action and the name, address, and telephone number of the consumer reporting agency. The Adverse Action Notice form should be sent along with the federal summary of rights and any applicable state summary of rights. The notice includes a statutorily required statement that the consumer reporting agency did not make the decision and does not know why the decision was made should be included as well as a notice of the applicant's right to obtain the report and dispute the information.

**Step 5: Maintain Documentation**

For all adverse decisions, document each step taken. Keep copies of all consent and disclosure forms and other documentation sent to the applicant in the event the company has to defend its decision at some later point.

**Record Retention**

All documents related to the background check process must be retained for at least five years.

**Equal Employment Laws**

IllumiDesk will adhere to all equal employment laws. When reviewing any criminal record information that appears on a background check, the company shall factor in any known factors relating to:

1. The facts and circumstances surrounding the offense.
2. The number of offenses for which the individual was convicted.
3. The age of the individual at the time of conviction or release from prison.
4. Evidence that the individual has performed the same type of work, post-conviction, with the same or a different employer, without incidents of criminal conduct.
5. The length and consistency of employment history before and after the offense.
6. Any efforts of the applicant towards rehabilitation.
7. Employment or character references obtained regarding the individual’s fitness for the particular position.
8. Whether the individual will be bonded for the position.

**Financial Checks**

Finance team members **only** will be required to participate in a federal check through Sterling, which searches for any tax-related or financial offenses. See this page for process details.

#### Job Abandonment <a id="job-abandonment"></a>

When a team member is absent from work for three consecutive workdays, there is no entry on the availability calendar for time off, and fails to contact his or her supervisor, they can be terminated for job abandonment unless otherwise required by law.

If a manager is unable to reach a team member via email or slack within a 24 hour period they should contact their People Business Partner. The People Business partner will access the team member's information to obtain additional contact methods and numbers. The manager and People Business Partner will create an action plan to make all attempts to contact the team member.

#### Other People Policies <a id="other-people-policies"></a>

* United States Employment Status
* PIAA Agreements
* 360 Feedback
* Return of Property
* Promotions and Transfers
* General Benefits
* Entity Specific Benefits
* Parental Leave
* Paid Time Off
* Probation Period

#### Partner Due Diligence <a id="partner-due-diligence"></a>

IllumiDesk's Anti-Bribery Policy prohibit giving illegal or improper payments to, or receiving such payments from, any person or organization, including government officials \(U.S. and foreign\) and persons in the private sector. Such payments also are prohibited by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act \("FCPA"\) and anti-bribery laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions, including but not limited to the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and the European Commission on Anti-Corruption \(collectively, “Anti-Bribery Laws”\).

IllumiDesk's export policy requires that we ensure compliance with applicable export laws including the Export Administration Regulations \(EAR\), the International Traffic in Arms Regulations \(ITAR\) \(if and to the extent they become applicable to IllumiDesk's products\), general prohibitions and country control lists \(collectively “Export Laws”\).

It is an offense under Anti-Bribery Laws for a company to engage a third party who pays bribes in connection with the company’s business. Additionally, it is an offense under US Export Laws for a company to engage a third party who violates export laws. In short, IllumiDesk can be held criminally and civilly liable for the bad acts of its partners.

Therefore, the Anti-Bribery, Anti-Corruption and Export Policy applies not only to IllumiDesk's employees, but also to all resellers, agents, consultants, joint venture partners or other representatives who provide services directly related to obtaining, retaining or facilitating businesses or business opportunities for IllumiDesk \(“Partners”\).

In order to minimize the risk relating to Anti-Bribery Law and Export Law violations from such third parties, due diligence will be conducted on IllumiDesk Partners. Due diligence is the process of taking reasonable steps to satisfy legal requirements and ensure that there are no red flags associated with the respective Partner \("Due Diligence"\). The manager of the relationship is responsible for ensuring that the Due Diligence is conducted.

For IllumiDesk, Due Diligence is verification that the proper contract terms are in play with the appropriate parties and verification that no Red Flags are present prior to moving forward in a relationship. If a red flag is present, the matter should be escalated to Legal. Legal will make a recommendation on whether or not to pursue the relationship based on the circumstances. Legal, at its sole discretion, will document justification for its final disposition.

Red Flags include: A poor credit check; Presence of media reports or rumours relating to illegal payments, bribes, export violations, corruption or other criminal activity; Requesting an unusually high commission if an agent or if a reseller is requesting to be paid money; Partner requesting a cash payment or payment to a secret account; Partner requesting third parties to be added to a contract; Partner refuses to disclose owners or principals for purposes of a credit check; Partner attempts to negotiate around \(or refuses to agree to\) terms around penalties around corruption or violation of law; and/or A negative hit on Denied Party Screen. \(Denied Party Screens are conducted by Legal or Compliance.\)

Please contact Legal or Compliance with questions or concerns about this section.

#### Partner Code of Ethics <a id="partner-code-of-ethics"></a>
