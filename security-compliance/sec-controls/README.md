# Security Controls

## IllumiDesk's Security Controls <a id="gitlabs-security-controls"></a>

IllumiDesk bases its security controls on the [SOC for Service Organizations: Trust Services Criteria](https://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/serviceorganization-smanagement.html). SOC2 defines **trust service categories** that service organizations should implement. Generally, the implementation of these trust principles begin with the definition of controls. Then, the controls reference policies and procedures that document how the controls are implemented within an organization. Finally, the organization should maintain verifiable evidence that the policies and procedures referenced by the organization's controls are being adequately followed.

The five trust principles are summarized below:

### **1. Security**

The security principle refers to protection of system resources against unauthorized access. Items such as web application firewalls \(WAF\), two-factor authentication, and vulnerability scans are examples of tools that organizations use to ensure the proper security policies are in place.

### **2. Availability**

The availability principle refers to the accessibility of information used by the entity’s systems as well as the products or services provided to its customers. Accessibility standards are usually established by the entity's service level agreements \(SLAs\). Business continuity plans and disaster recovery plans are examples of policies and procedures defined by the organization to meet availability controls.

### **3. Processing integrity**

Processing integrity refers to the completeness, validity, accuracy, timeliness, and authorization of system processing \(i.e., delivers the right data at the right price at the right time\). Monitoring access to data and ensuring ETL pipelines are properly implemented are two examples of how entities can ensure processing integrity.

### **4. Confidentiality**

Information designated as confidential is protected to meet the entity’s objectives. Organizations should have criteria defined to classify confidential information. Procedures to secure confidential data, such as encrypting data in transfer and at rest, are part of how an entity provides adequate procedures to protect confidential data from prying eyes.

### **5. Privacy**

Personal information is collected, used, retained, disclosed, and disposed of to meet the entity’s objectives. Although confidentiality applies to various types of sensitive information, privacy applies only to personal information. An organization needs to consider applicable laws and regulations, as well as industry and client-specific privacy requirements when defining policies and procedures to protect private data.

### IllumiDesk Trust Control Framework \(ITCF\) <a id="gitlab-control-framework-gcf"></a>

IllumiDesk has tried to take a comprehensive approach to our immediate and future security compliance needs. Instead of attempting to juggle various requirements in parallels such as PCI, ISO, and SOC2, IllumiDesk has adopted standard SOC2 trust principles to establish a baseline trust control framework.
