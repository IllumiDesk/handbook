# IllumiDesk Reference Architectures

IllumiDesk is a modular, highly scalable application, distributed in a variety of packaged formats. When properly configured, it can accommodate from ten, to hundreds of thousands of users.

It should be noted that our distribution provides a reliable service even on a single server without any special configuration. As your organization grows, however, IllumiDesk has the flexibility to expand according to your business needs.

For example:

* Growth in headcount might mean youâ€™ll need to allocate additional resources to your existing installation.
* You may have strict uptime requirements which call for High Availability \(HA\) solutions and/or zero-downtime upgrades.
* Expanding into new geographical regions means that your teams need performant access to IllumiDesk.
* Your business may require plans for quick restoration of service in the case of a disaster.

All solutions come with a trade-off between cost/complexity and uptime. An increase in complexity requires domain knowledge to successfully set up and maintain. With this in mind, you should thoroughly analyze the benefits of a highly available solution against its costs. It is important that you always choose something that you have experience with. A badly implemented HA solution can cause more downtime than it solves.

Properly configured, IllumiDesk can address all of the above cases.

For technical implementation details, see our reference architectures documentation.
