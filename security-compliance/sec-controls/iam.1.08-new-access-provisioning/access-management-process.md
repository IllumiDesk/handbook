# Access Management Process

Centralized access management is key to ensuring that the correct IllumiDesk  team-members have access to the correct data and systems and at the correct level. IllumiDesk access controls are guided by the principle of least privilege and need-to-know. These controls apply to information and information processing systems at the application and operating system layers, including networks and network services.

The access request project is used to request and track the following access-related activities:

1. New Access Requests
2. Access Removal Requests
3. Access Reviews
4. New Service Account Requests

Usage guidelines for each of the access templates is outlined on the IT Operation's handbook page.

These templates should be used during the onboarding process and throughout the employment tenure. Access required as part of the team member's onboarding should be requested using the New Access Requests or if applicable, one of the available Role-based entitlements templates.
