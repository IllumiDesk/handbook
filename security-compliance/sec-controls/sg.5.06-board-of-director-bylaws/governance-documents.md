\(b\) If at any meeting action is proposed to be taken which, if taken, would entitle stockholders fulfilling the requirements of section 262\(d\) of the Delaware General Corporation Law to an appraisal of the fair value of their shares, the notice of such meeting shall contain a statement of that purpose and to that effect and shall be accompanied by a copy of that statutory section.

\(c\) When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken unless the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or unless after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in which event a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

\(d\) Notice of the time, place and purpose of any meeting of stockholders may be waived in writing, either before or after such meeting, and, to the extent permitted by law, will be waived by any stockholder by his attendance thereat, in person or by proxy. Any stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had been given.

\(e\) Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the corporation under any provision of Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate of incorporation, or these Restated Bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if \(i\) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent, and \(ii\) such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided that the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given pursuant to this Section 2.4\(e\) shall be deemed given: \(A\) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; \(B\) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; \(C\) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of \(1\) such posting and \(2\) the giving of such separate notice; and \(D\) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

#### **Section 2.5 - Quorum and Voting** <a id="section-25---quorum-and-voting"></a>

\(a\) At all meetings of stockholders except where otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Restated Bylaws, the presence, in person or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Shares, the voting of which at said meeting have been enjoined, or which for any reason cannot be lawfully voted at such meeting, shall not be counted to determine a quorum at said meeting. In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from time to time, by a vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares represented thereat, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting. The stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a “quorum.”

\(b\) Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Restated Bylaws, all action taken by the holders of a majority of the voting power represented at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be valid and binding upon the corporation.

\(c\) Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, a majority of the voting power of the shares of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter, and the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class.

#### **Section 2.6 - Voting Rights** <a id="section-26---voting-rights"></a>

\(a\) Except as otherwise provided by law, only persons in whose names shares entitled to vote stand on the stock records of the corporation on the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting shall be entitled to vote at such meeting. Shares standing in the names of two or more persons shall be voted or represented in accordance with the determination of the majority of such persons, or, if only one of such persons is present in person or represented by proxy, such person shall have the right to vote such shares and such shares shall be deemed to be represented for the purpose of determining a quorum.

\(b\) Every person entitled to vote or to execute consents shall have the right to do so either in person or by an agent or agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or his duly authorized agent, which proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the corporation at or before the meeting at which it is to be used. Said proxy so appointed need not be a stockholder. No proxy shall be voted on after three years from its date unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Unless and until voted, every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the person who executed it or of his legal representatives or assigns, except in those cases where an irrevocable proxy permitted by statute has been given.

\(c\) Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him as proxy pursuant to Section 2.6\(b\), the following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority:

\(1\) A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for him as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the stockholder or his authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature.

\(2\) A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telephone, telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such telephone, telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telephone, telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. Such authorization can be established by the signature of the stockholder on the proxy, either in writing or by a signature stamp or facsimile signature, or by a number or symbol from which the identity of the stockholder can be determined, or by any other procedure deemed appropriate by the inspectors or other persons making the determination as to due authorization. If it is determined that such telegrams, cablegrams or other electronic transmissions are valid, the inspectors or,if there are no inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall specify the information upon which they relied.

\(d\) Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to Section 2.6\(c\) may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used,provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.

#### **Section 2.7 - Voting Procedures and Inspectors of Elections** <a id="section-27---voting-procedures-and-inspectors-of-elections"></a>

\(a\) The corporation shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. The corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability.

\(b\) The inspectors shall \(i\) ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, \(ii\) determine the shares represented at a meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, \(iii\) count all votes and ballots, \(iv\) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and \(v\) certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of all votes and ballots. The inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist the inspectors in the performance of the duties of the inspectors.

\(c\) The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting. No ballot, proxies or votes, nor any revocations thereof or changes thereto, shall be accepted by the inspectors after the closing of the polls unless the Court of Chancery upon application by a stockholder shall determine otherwise.

\(d\) In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots, the inspectors shall be limited to an examination of the proxies, any envelopes submitted with those proxies, any information provided in accordance with Sections 211\(e\) or 212\(c\)\(2\) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or any information provided pursuant to Section 211\(a\)\(2\) \(B\)\(i\) or \(iii\) thereof, ballots and the regular books and records of the corporation, except that the inspectors may consider other reliable information for the limited purpose of reconciling proxies and ballots submitted by or on behalf of banks, brokers,their nominees or similar persons which represent more votes than the holder of a proxy is authorized by the record owner to cast or more votes than the stockholder holds of record. If the inspectors consider other reliable information for the limited purpose permitted herein, the inspectors at the time they make their certification pursuant to Section 2.7\(b\) shall specify the precise information considered by them including the person or persons from whom they obtained the information, when the information was obtained, the means by which the information was obtained and the basis for the inspectors’ belief that such information is accurate and reliable.

#### **Section 2.8 - List of Stockholders** <a id="section-28---list-of-stockholders"></a>

The corporation need not include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting: \(i\) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or \(ii\) during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the corporation. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be examined by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.

If the stockholder is not seeking inclusion of the proposal in the corporation’s proxy statement or information statement, timely notice consists of a stockholder’s notice delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than 90 days prior to the date of the annual meeting.

Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved \(as a party, witness, or otherwise\), in any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative \(hereinafter a “Proceeding”\), by reason of the fact that he, or a person of whom he is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the corporation or, while serving as a director or officer, is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of the Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director or officer or in any other capacity \(hereafter a “Covered Person”\), shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted \(but, in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto\) against all expenses, liability, and loss \(including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties, and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement, and any interest, assessments, or other charges imposed thereon, and any federal, state, local, or foreign taxes imposed on any Covered Person as a result of the actual or deemed receipt of any payments under this Article 8\) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in, or participating in \(including on appeal\), or preparing for any of the foregoing in, any Proceeding \(hereinafter “Expenses”\); provided that except as to actions to enforce indemnification rights pursuant to Section 8.3 of this Article 8, the corporation shall indemnify any Covered Person seeking indemnification in connection with a Proceeding \(or part thereof\) initiated by such Covered Person only if the Proceeding \(or part thereof\) was authorized by the Board.

The burden of proving such a defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation \(including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders\) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper under the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the corporation \(including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders\) that the claimant had not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

All notices given by mail, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given as at the time of mailing and all notices given by means of electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been given as at the sending time recorded by the electronic transmission equipment operator transmitting the same.
