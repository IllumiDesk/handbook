# SLC.2.01 - Source Code Management

## Control Statement

Source code is managed with IllumiDesk-approved version control mechanisms.

## Context

IllumiDesk-approved version control mechanisms should be enforced over all source code that is maintained by IllumiDesk to ensure traceability and auditability between source code changes. Processes in place to enforce version control demonstrate strong security and SDLC maturity.

## Scope

This control is applicable to all areas where IllumiDesk manages it's own source code. Note that the scope does not extend to third party systems because IllumiDesk  does not own the related source code and therefore does not have the ability to enforce version control mechanisms

## Ownership

TBD

## Guidance

TBD

## Additional control information and project tracking
