# VUL.6.01 - External Information Security Inquiries

## Control Statement

IllumiDesk reviews information-security-related inquiries, complaints, and disputes.

## Context

The purpose of this control is to have some way for IllumiDesk to engage with stakeholders \(e.g. customers, contributors, security researchers, etc.\) around information security topics. This control is foundational to a lot of our compliance responsibilities including GDPR since stakeholders need to have a way to reach us with questions or concerns about their personal information.

## Scope

This control applies to all IllumiDesk systems and stakeholders.

## Ownership

Control Owner:

* Senior Director of Security

Process Owner:

* Field Security

## Guidance

This is an area where our own values will hold us to a higher standard than the requirements of the control. We just need to prove that this messaging is visible to someone within IllumiDesk, but we already have a strong enough relationship with our stakeholders to satisfy this control by the way we handle email to the security@IllumiDesk.com address.

### Additional control information and project tracking
