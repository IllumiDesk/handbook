# PR.1.01 - Background Checks



### Control Statement

New hires are required to pass a background check as a condition of their employment. When not performed, documentation outlining the exception is retained.

###  Context

IllumiDesk is concerned about the safety of all IllumiDesk team-members and about maintaining appropriate controls to ensure that assets of IllumiDesk and our customer relationships and information are protected. To reduce these risks, IllumiDesk will obtain and review background information of covered prospective, and, as applicable, current IllumiDesk team-members.

This information comes from our handbook and more details about our background check process can be found there.

###  Scope

Background checks apply to all IllumiDesk team-members that do not live in a country or state that conflicts with this practice.
