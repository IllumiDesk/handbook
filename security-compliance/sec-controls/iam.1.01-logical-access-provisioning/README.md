# IAM.1.01 - Logical Access Provisioning



### Control Statement

Logical access provisioning requires approval from appropriate personnel.

###  Context

The purpose of this control is to ensure there is a process in place to review and authorize new user account requests. Ensuring only people who require access to a system or service receive access helps improve IllumiDesk's overall security posture by limiting the number of accounts with access and reducing the overall likelihood of an account being compromised.

###  Scope

This control applies to any system or service where user accounts can be provisioned.

###  Ownership

Control ownership:

* IT Operations

Process ownership:

* IT Operations
* Managers
* Systems Owners

###  Guidance

Provisioning should be based on predetermined roles with business justification and management approval. The process owner should use role-based authentication whenever possible to make this control easier and to segregate out this function from that of other system functions.

###  Additional control information and project tracking

Non-public information relating to this security control as well as links to the work associated with various phases of project work can be found in the Logical Access Provisioning control issue.
