# TPM.1.01 - Third Party Assurance Review

## Control Statement

Quarterly, management reviews controls within third party assurance reports to ensure that they meet organizational requirements; if control gaps are identified in the assurance reports, management takes action to address impact the disclosed gaps have on the organization.

## Context

It's common for companies like IllumiDesk to offload risk and services to third parties.; most SaaS companies these days rely heavily on other SaaS products. In order to create a chain of trust, the security control for any third party providers IllumiDesk uses need to be validated. Since the security of a whole system is only as good as the least secure component, we need to do everything we can to ensure that all third party providers used by IllumiDesk meet or exceed the bar we have set for security controls.

An auditor will, dependent on the scope of the audit, select a sample of third-party vendors or review all that handle IllumiDesk RED or ORANGE data to validate review of their security practices has been completed.

## Scope

This control applies to all third party providers that interact with data within the IllumiDesk production environment, or any third party providers that a IllumiDesk production system relies upon.

## Ownership

Control Owner:

* `Security Compliance`

Process Owner:

* Security Compliance

##  Guidance

* The easiest way to satisfy this control is to review all third party provider SOC2 Type 2 reports for appropriate scope and efficacy of controls.
* If a SOC2 Type 2 report is not available, we can send these third party providers a IllumiDesk security questionnaire to gather the necessary information about the security controls they have in place and the approximate state of maturity of that third party provider.

## Additional control information and project tracking
