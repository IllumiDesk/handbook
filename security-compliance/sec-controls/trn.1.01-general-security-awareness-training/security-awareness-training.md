# Security Awareness Training

## Overview

The IllumiDesk Security Training is IllumiDesk's security awareness presentation for new hires and annual training requirements. The training is originally part of the onboarding process, and needs to be completed by every new hire. We are trying to make it fun, engaging and not time-consuming.

The training is being actively developed by IllumiDesk Security's Security Operations team. The goal of the training is to:

1. Make all IllumiDesk team-members aware of the IllumiDesk  Security team, and familiarize them with our efforts, team structure, and people.
2. Make all IllumiDesk team-members aware of the importance of their role in securing IllumiDesk on a daily basis, and to empower them to make the right decisions with security best-practices.
3. Familiarize all new IllumiDesk team-members with security-related situations that they might encounter during their tenure with the company.
4. Help all IllumiDesk team-members internalize and reinforce the idea that paging the Security On-Call is an encouraged practice.

## Training Delivery

The Security Training is delivered through a pre-recorded presentation that is presented by a member of the Security Operations team. The following materials are made available for your consumption:

* The video - the actual training.
* The slides - the slides used in the training video.
* Security Practices - a list of security process and procedures that you can consult at any time.
