# Timekeeping & Payroll

### 7.1 Attendance & Punctuality

Absenteeism and tardiness place an undue burden on other employees and on the Company. IllumiDesk LLC expects regular attendance and punctuality from all employees. This means being in the workplace, ready to work, at your scheduled start time each day and completing your entire shift. Employees are also expected to return from scheduled meal and break periods on time.

All time off must be requested in writing, in advance, as outlined in the Company’s Paid Time Off \(PTO\) policy. If an employee is unexpectedly unable to report for work for any reason, he or she must directly notify their supervisor as early as possible, and preferably prior to their scheduled starting time. It is not acceptable to leave a voicemail message with a supervisor, except in extreme emergencies. In cases that warrant leaving a voicemail message or when an employee’s direct supervisor is unavailable, a follow-up call must be made later that day.

If an illness or emergency occurs during work hours, employees should notify their supervisor as soon as possible.

Employees, who are going to be absent for more than one day, should contact their supervisor on each day of their absence. IllumiDesk LLC reserves the right to ask for a physician's statement in the event of a long-term illness \(three consecutive days\), or multiple illnesses or injuries.

If an employee fails to notify their supervisor after three consecutive days of absence, IllumiDesk LLC will presume that the employee has voluntarily resigned. IllumiDesk LLC will review any extenuating circumstances that may have prevented him or her from calling in before the employee is removed from payroll.

Should undue or recurrent absence and tardiness become apparent, the employee will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

This policy is not intended to restrict an employee’s right to discuss, or act together to improve, wages, benefits and working conditions with co-workers or in any way restrict employees’ rights under the National Labor Relations Act.

### 7.2 Timekeeping

It is the Company's policy to comply with applicable laws that require records to be maintained of the hours worked by our employees. Every employee is responsible for accurately recording time worked.

In addition to recording arrival and departure time, non-exempt employees are required to accurately record the start and end of each meal period as well as any departure for non-work related reasons.

IllumiDesk LLC strictly prohibits non-exempt employees from working off the clock for any reason. All time spent working must be logged and accounted for; this includes time spent using electronic devices for work-related purposes.

Vacation days, sick days, holidays, and absences for jury duty, funeral leave or military training must be specifically recorded by all employees.

It is the responsibility of all employees to submit and approve their time records each week.

Altering, falsifying, tampering with time records, or recording time on another employee's time record may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

### 7.3 Paydays

IllumiDesk LLC employees are paid on a Semi-monthly basis. In the event that a regularly scheduled payday falls on a holiday, employees will be paid on the day preceding the holiday, unless otherwise required by state law.

Paychecks will not, under any circumstances, be given to any person other than the employee without written authorization. Paychecks may also be mailed to the employee's listed address or, upon advance written authorization, deposited directly into an employee's bank account. Employees who elect payment through direct deposit will receive an itemized statement of wages when the Company makes direct deposits.

In the event of employee termination, the employee will receive their accrued pay in accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws.

### 7.4 Payroll Deductions

IllumiDesk LLC makes deductions from employee pay only in circumstances permitted by applicable law. This includes, but is not limited to, mandatory deductions for income tax withholding and Social Security and Medicare contributions as well as voluntary deductions for health insurance premiums and other related contributions.

If you believe that an improper deduction has been made from your pay, raise the issue with the Human Resources Representative immediately. IllumiDesk LLC will promptly investigate. If the investigation reveals that you were subjected to an improper deduction from pay, you will be reimbursed promptly.
