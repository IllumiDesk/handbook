### 5.4 Paid Time Off \(PTO\)

Paid Time Off \(PTO\) is an all-purpose time off policy for eligible employees to use for vacation, illness, injury, or personal business. PTO combines traditional vacation and sick leave plans into one flexible, inclusive policy. PTO is payable in the same manner as the regular salary and is subject to the same withholding elections.

Employees in the following employment classification\(s\) are eligible to earn and use PTO as described in this policy: Full-time employees only

Upon entering an eligible employment classification, employees will begin to earn PTO according to the following schedule:

After 0 year\(s\) of service employees are eligible for 10 PTO Days.

To the extent permitted by state and local laws, employees must use their earned time prior to December 31 of the calendar year; otherwise the time will be forfeited.

Paid time off is paid at your base pay rate at the time of the absence. It does not include overtime or any special forms of compensation such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift differential.

Employees with an unexpected need \(i.e. sudden illness or emergency\) to request PTO should notify their direct supervisor as early as possible. Employees must also contact their direct supervisor on each additional day of absence.

Work-related accidents and illness are covered by Workers' Compensation Insurance, pursuant to the requirements of the laws in the state\(s\) in which IllumiDesk LLC operates. The PTO policy outlined above does not apply to those illnesses or injuries that are covered by an applicable Workers' Compensation policy.

In-laws \(including mother and father-in-laws and brother and sister-in-laws\)

Because of the deep impact that death can have on an individual or a family,

additional unpaid time off may be granted on a discretionary basis. Such arrangements must be approved by the employee's supervisor.

To be eligible for paid time off for bereavement, employees are expected to notify their supervisors at the earliest opportunity so that the supervisor can try to arrange coverage for the employee's absence. In addition, 3BLADES LLC may require verification of the need for the leave.

### 5.6 Employee Referral Program

IllumiDesk LLC offers an employee referral program to encourage employees to recommend qualified candidates. Our referral program provides employees with a referral bonus for successful hires made based upon an employee's recommendation.

All referred candidates will be considered and evaluated based on experience and qualifications and will be subject to the same pre-employment standards as all other candidates.

Questions regarding this policy should be directed to the Human Resources Representative.

### 5.7 Military Leave

IllumiDesk LLC grants employees time off for service, training and other obligations in the uniformed services in accordance with the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act \(USERRA\) and any other applicable state law.

All employees requesting time off for military service must provide advance notice to their immediate supervisor, unless military necessity prevents such notice or it is otherwise impracticable. Continuation of health insurance benefits is available during military leave subject to the terms and conditions of the group health plan and applicable law.

Employees are eligible for reemployment for up to five years from the date their military leave began. The period an individual has to apply for reemployment or report back to work after military service is based on time spent on military duty and on applicable law. For reinstatement guidelines, contact the Human Resources Representative.

Employees who qualify for reemployment will return to work at a pay level and status equal to that which they would have attained had they not taken military leave. They will be treated as though they were continuously employed for purposes of determining benefits based on length of service.

IllumiDesk LLC complies with all rights and protections under all applicable state laws granting time off for service, training and other obligations in the uniformed services.

IllumiDesk LLC encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities when called upon to serve as a juror. Employees must provide their immediate supervisor with a copy of their jury summons as soon as possible so that the supervisor may make arrangements to accommodate their absence.

Employees on jury duty must report to work on workdays, or parts of workdays, when they are not required to serve. Either IllumiDesk LLC or the employee may request an excuse from jury duty if it is determined that the employee's absence would create serious operational difficulties.

Jury duty will be paid if required by applicable state law. If paid, jury duty pay will be calculated on the employee's base pay rate times the number of hours the employee would otherwise have worked on the day of absence.

IllumiDesk LLC may specify the hours during which the employee may take leave to vote. Such time will generally be limited to the beginning or end of a working shift unless otherwise mutually agreed.

If there are fewer than two consecutive hours between the opening of the polls and the beginning of an employee's workday or between the end of an employee's workday and the closing of the polls, an employee may take up to two hours of leave to vote on Election Day.

Below are the flexible work arrangements available at IllumiDesk LLC:

Compressed workweek: Compressed workweek: Employees are required to work their typically scheduled hours, but may do so in a shorter period of time. For example, an employee may work four ten-hour days each week rather than their typical five eight-hour days.

Flex-time: Flex-time: Flex-time is designed to address the needs of employees who are unable to work during the Company's typical hours of operation. Flex- time allows employees to work their required hours either earlier or later than the typical workday.

Telecommuting: Telecommuting: Although employees are encouraged to report to their work location whenever possible, we realize that there may be circumstances in which employees may not be able to make it in. When these instances do arise, employees may be permitted to work from home, but are required to check into the office regularly.

Employees that are unable to fulfill their normal scheduling demands may request one of the above schedule arrangements. All requests must be submitted writing to your supervisor and will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

This policy is not intended to diminish or replace any entitlement employees have to a flexible work arrangement under federal, state or local laws. While IllumiDesk LLC does not guarantee that your scheduling request will be granted, IllumiDesk LLC will abide by all applicable laws when reviewing requests for flexible work arrangements.

Questions regarding this policy should be directed toward your supervisor or the

Human Resources Representative.

Eligibility Requirements: Eligibility Requirements:

Employees eligible for leave under the FMLA are those who: \(1\) have worked at least 6 months for IllumiDesk LLC; \(2\) have worked for at least 625 hours during the 6 month period immediately preceding the start date of the requested leave; and \(3\) are employed at a worksite where 50 or more employees are located within 75 miles of the worksite.

Basic FMLA Leave Entitlement: Basic FMLA Leave Entitlement:

The FMLA grants up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to eligible employees for the following reasons: \(1\) to care for the employee's child following birth or placement for adoption or foster care; \(2\) to care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter or parent \(but not in-law\) who has a serious health condition; \(3\) for the employee's own serious health condition \(including any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, prenatal medical care, or child birth\) that makes the employee unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of the employee's job; or \(4\) because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that an employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member who is a member of a regular component of the Armed Forces on active duty or who has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty status for deployment to any foreign country in the regular or reserve components of the Armed Forces, including the National Guard or Reserves.

A serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves either an overnight stay in a medical care facility, or continuing treatment by a health care provider for a condition that either prevents the employee from performing the functions of the employee's job, or prevents the qualified family member from participating in school or other daily activities. Subject

to certain conditions, the continuing treatment requirement may be met by a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days combined with at least two visits to a health care provider or one visit and a regimen of continuing treatment, or incapacity due to pregnancy, or incapacity due to a chronic condition. Other conditions may meet the definition of continuing treatment.

Qualifying exigencies may include attending certain military events, arranging for alternative childcare, addressing certain financial and legal arrangements, attending certain counseling sessions, and attending post-deployment reintegration briefings.

Additional Military Family Leave Entitlement: Additional Military Family Leave Entitlement:

In addition to the basic FMLA leave entitlement discussed above, an eligible employee who is the spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin of a covered servicemember is entitled to take up to 26 weeks of leave during a single 12-month period to care for the servicemember with a serious injury or illness. Leave to care for a servicemember shall only be available during a single-12 month period and, when combined with other FMLA-qualifying leave, may not exceed 26 weeks during the single 12-month period. The single 12-month period begins on the first day an eligible employee takes leave to care for the injured servicemember.

A covered servicemember means a member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, and/or a veteran of the Armed Forces, including a veteran of the National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is on the temporary retired list, for a serious injury or illness. Such veteran is considered a covered servicemember if he/she was a member of the Armed Forces, including the National Guard and Reserves, at any time during the five-year period preceding the date on which the veteran undergoes medical treatment, recuperation or therapy. A covered servicemember of the Armed Forces would have a serious injury or illness if he/she has incurred an injury or illness in the line of duty while on active duty in the Armed Forces or if he/she has an injury or illness that was incurred before the covered servicemember's active duty and was aggravated by service in the line of duty while on activity duty; provided that the injury or illness may render the servicemember medically unfit to perform duties of the member's office, grade, rank or rating. A serious injury or illness of a veteran is further defined to encompass an injury or illness incurred in the line of duty while on active duty, or which existed prior to active duty but was aggravated by service in the line of duty while on active duty, and that manifested itself either before or after the covered servicemember became a veteran.

Intermittent Leave and Reduced Leave Schedules: Intermittent Leave and Reduced Leave Schedules:

FMLA leave usually will be taken for a period of consecutive days, weeks or months. However, employees also are entitled to take FMLA leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when medically necessary due to a serious health condition of the employee or covered family member or the serious injury or illness of a covered servicemember.

Protection of Group Health Insurance Benefits: Protection of Group Health Insurance Benefits:

During FMLA leave, eligible employees are entitled to receive group health plan coverage on the same terms a nd conditions as if they had continued to work.

Restoration of Employment and Benefits: Restoration of Employment and Benefits:

At the end of FMLA leave, subject to some exceptions including situations where job restoration of “key employees” will cause the Company substantial and grievous economic injury, employees generally have a right to return to the same or equivalent positions with equivalent pay, benefits and other employment terms. The Company will notify employees if they qualify as “key employees”, if it intends to deny reinstatement, and of their rights in such instances. Use of FMLA leave will not result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the start of an eligible employee's FMLA leave.

Notice of Eligibility for, and Designation of, FMLA Leave: Notice of Eligibility for, and Designation of, FMLA Leave:

Employees requesting FMLA leave are entitled to receive written notice from IllumiDesk LLC telling them whether they are eligible for FMLA leave and, if not eligible, the reasons why they are not eligible. When eligible for FMLA leave, employees are entitled to receive written notice of: \(1\) their rights and responsibilities in connection with such leave; \(2\) the Company's designation of leave as FMLA-qualifying or non-qualifying, if not FMLA-qualifying, the reasons why; and \(3\) the amount of leave, if known, that will be counted against the employee's leave entitlement.

IllumiDesk LLC may retroactively designate leave as FMLA leave with appropriate written notice to employees provided the Company's failure to designate leave as FMLA-qualifying at an earlier date did not cause harm or injury to the employee. In

all cases where leaves qualify for FMLA protection, IllumiDesk LLC and the employee can mutually agree that leave be retroactively designated as FMLA leave.

Notice of the Need for Leave: Notice of the Need for Leave:

Employees who take FMLA leave must timely notify IllumiDesk LLC of their need for FMLA leave. The following describes the content and timing of such employee notices.

Content of Employee Notice: Content of Employee Notice:

To trigger FMLA leave protections, employees must inform the Human Resources Representative of the need for FMLA-qualifying leave and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave, if known. Employees may do this by either requesting FMLA leave specifically, or explaining the reasons for leave so as to allow the Company to determine that the leave is FMLA-qualifying.

Calling in “sick,” without providing the reasons for the needed leave, will not be considered sufficient notice for FMLA leave under this policy. Employees must respond to the Company's questions to determine if absences are potentially FMLA-qualifying.

If employees fail to explain the reasons for FMLA leave, the leave may be denied. When employees seek leave due to FMLA-qualifying reasons for which the Company has previously provided FMLA-protected leave, they must specifically reference the qualifying reason for the leave or the need for FMLA leave.

Timing of Employee Notice: Timing of Employee Notice:

Employees must provide 30 days advance notice of the need to take FMLA leave when the need is foreseeable. When 30 days notice is not possible, or the approximate timing of the need for leave is not foreseeable, employees must provide the Company notice of the need for leave as soon as practicable under the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Employees who fail to give 30 days notice for foreseeable leave without a reasonable excuse for the delay, or otherwise fail to satisfy FMLA notice obligations, may have FMLA leave delayed or denied.

Medical Certifications: Medical Certifications:

Depending on the nature of FMLA leave sought, employees may be required to submit medical certifications supporting their need for FMLA-qualifying leave. It is Page 29 of 45

the employee's responsibility to provide IllumiDesk LLC with timely, complete and sufficient medical certifications. Employees must provide the requested certifications within 15 calendar days following the Company's request, unless it is not practicable to do so. IllumiDesk LLC may deny FMLA leave to employees who fail to timely cure deficiencies or otherwise fail to timely submit requested medical certifications.

Employees requesting leave because of their own, or a covered relation's, serious health condition, or to care for a covered servicemember, must supply medical certification supporting the need for such leave from their health care provider or, if applicable, the health care provider of their covered family or service member. If employees provide at least 30 days notice of medical leave, they should submit the medical certification before leave begins.

Certifications Supporting Need for Military Family Leave: Certifications Supporting Need for Military Family Leave:

Upon request, the first time employees seek leave due to qualifying exigencies arising out of the active duty or call to active duty status of a covered military member, the Company may require employees to provide: \(1\) a copy of the covered military member's active duty orders or other documentation issued by the military indicating the covered military member is on active duty or call to active duty status and the dates of the covered military member's active duty service; and \(2\) a certification from the employee setting forth information concerning the nature of the qualifying exigency for which leave is requested. Employees shall provide a copy of new active duty orders or other documentation issued by the military for leaves arising out of qualifying exigencies arising out of a different active duty or call to active duty status of the same or a different covered military member.

When leave is taken to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness, IllumiDesk LLC may require employees to obtain certifications completed by an authorized health care provider of the covered servicemember.

Substitution of Paid Leave for Unpaid FMLA Leave: Substitution of Paid Leave for Unpaid FMLA Leave:

Employees must use any accrued paid time while taking unpaid FMLA leave. The substitution of paid time for unpaid FMLA leave time does not extend the length of FMLA leaves; the paid time will run concurrently with an employee's FMLA entitlement.

Leaves of absence taken in connection with a disability leave plan or workers'

compensation injury/illness shall run concurrently with any FMLA leave entitlement.

Coordination of FMLA Leave with Other Leave Policies: Coordination of FMLA Leave with Other Leave Policies:

The FMLA does not affect any federal, state or local law prohibiting discrimination, or supersede any State or local law which provides greater family or medical leave rights. For additional information concerning leave entitlements and obligations that might arise when FMLA leave is either not available or exhausted, please contact the Human Resources Representative.
