A serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves either an overnight stay in a medical care facility, or continuing treatment by a health care provider for a condition that either prevents the employee from performing the functions of the employee's job, or prevents the qualified family member from participating in school or other daily activities. Subject

Page 26 of 45

to certain conditions, the continuing treatment requirement may be met by a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days combined with at least two visits to a health care provider or one visit and a regimen of continuing treatment, or incapacity due to pregnancy, or incapacity due to a chronic condition. Other conditions may meet the definition of continuing treatment.

Qualifying exigencies may include attending certain military events, arranging for alternative childcare, addressing certain financial and legal arrangements, attending certain counseling sessions, and attending post-deployment reintegration briefings.

Additional Military Family Leave Entitlement: Additional Military Family Leave Entitlement:

In addition to the basic FMLA leave entitlement discussed above, an eligible employee who is the spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin of a covered servicemember is entitled to take up to 26 weeks of leave during a single 12-month period to care for the servicemember with a serious injury or illness. Leave to care for a servicemember shall only be available during a single-12 month period and, when combined with other FMLA-qualifying leave, may not exceed 26 weeks during the single 12-month period. The single 12-month period begins on the first day an eligible employee takes leave to care for the injured servicemember.

A covered servicemember means a member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, and/or a veteran of the Armed Forces, including a veteran of the National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is on the temporary retired list, for a serious injury or illness. Such veteran is considered a covered servicemember if he/she was a member of the Armed Forces, including the National Guard and Reserves, at any time during the five-year period preceding the date on which the veteran undergoes medical treatment, recuperation or therapy. A covered servicemember of the Armed Forces would have a serious injury or illness if he/she has incurred an injury or illness in the line of duty while on active duty in the Armed Forces or if he/she has an injury or illness that was incurred before the covered servicemember's active duty and was aggravated by service in the line of duty while on activity duty; provided that the injury or illness may render the servicemember medically unfit to perform duties of the member's office, grade, rank or rating. A serious injury or illness of a veteran is further defined to encompass an injury or illness incurred in the line of duty while on active duty, or which existed prior to active duty but was aggravated by service in the line of duty while on active duty, and that manifested itself either before or after the covered

Page 27 of 45

servicemember became a veteran.

Intermittent Leave and Reduced Leave Schedules: Intermittent Leave and Reduced Leave Schedules:

FMLA leave usually will be taken for a period of consecutive days, weeks or months. However, employees also are entitled to take FMLA leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when medically necessary due to a serious health condition of the employee or covered family member or the serious injury or illness of a covered servicemember.

Protection of Group Health Insurance Benefits: Protection of Group Health Insurance Benefits:

During FMLA leave, eligible employees are entitled to receive group health plan coverage on the same terms a nd conditions as if they had continued to work.

Restoration of Employment and Benefits: Restoration of Employment and Benefits:

At the end of FMLA leave, subject to some exceptions including situations where job restoration of “key employees” will cause the Company substantial and grievous economic injury, employees generally have a right to return to the same or equivalent positions with equivalent pay, benefits and other employment terms. The Company will notify employees if they qualify as “key employees”, if it intends to deny reinstatement, and of their rights in such instances. Use of FMLA leave will not result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the start of an eligible employee's FMLA leave.

Notice of Eligibility for, and Designation of, FMLA Leave: Notice of Eligibility for, and Designation of, FMLA Leave:

Employees requesting FMLA leave are entitled to receive written notice from 3BLADES LLC telling them whether they are eligible for FMLA leave and, if not eligible, the reasons why they are not eligible. When eligible for FMLA leave, employees are entitled to receive written notice of: \(1\) their rights and responsibilities in connection with such leave; \(2\) the Company's designation of leave as FMLA-qualifying or non-qualifying, if not FMLA-qualifying, the reasons why; and \(3\) the amount of leave, if known, that will be counted against the employee's leave entitlement.

3BLADES LLC may retroactively designate leave as FMLA leave with appropriate written notice to employees provided the Company's failure to designate leave as FMLA-qualifying at an earlier date did not cause harm or injury to the employee. In

Page 28 of 45

all cases where leaves qualify for FMLA protection, 3BLADES LLC and the employee can mutually agree that leave be retroactively designated as FMLA leave.

Notice of the Need for Leave: Notice of the Need for Leave:

Employees who take FMLA leave must timely notify 3BLADES LLC of their need for FMLA leave. The following describes the content and timing of such employee notices.

Content of Employee Notice: Content of Employee Notice:

To trigger FMLA leave protections, employees must inform the Human Resources Representative of the need for FMLA-qualifying leave and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave, if known. Employees may do this by either requesting FMLA leave specifically, or explaining the reasons for leave so as to allow the Company to determine that the leave is FMLA-qualifying.

Calling in “sick,” without providing the reasons for the needed leave, will not be considered sufficient notice for FMLA leave under this policy. Employees must respond to the Company's questions to determine if absences are potentially FMLA-qualifying.

If employees fail to explain the reasons for FMLA leave, the leave may be denied. When employees seek leave due to FMLA-qualifying reasons for which the Company has previously provided FMLA-protected leave, they must specifically reference the qualifying reason for the leave or the need for FMLA leave.

Timing of Employee Notice: Timing of Employee Notice:

Employees must provide 30 days advance notice of the need to take FMLA leave when the need is foreseeable. When 30 days notice is not possible, or the approximate timing of the need for leave is not foreseeable, employees must provide the Company notice of the need for leave as soon as practicable under the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Employees who fail to give 30 days notice for foreseeable leave without a reasonable excuse for the delay, or otherwise fail to satisfy FMLA notice obligations, may have FMLA leave delayed or denied.

Medical Certifications: Medical Certifications:

Depending on the nature of FMLA leave sought, employees may be required to submit medical certifications supporting their need for FMLA-qualifying leave. It is Page 29 of 45

the employee's responsibility to provide 3BLADES LLC with timely, complete and sufficient medical certifications. Employees must provide the requested certifications within 15 calendar days following the Company's request, unless it is not practicable to do so. 3BLADES LLC may deny FMLA leave to employees who fail to timely cure deficiencies or otherwise fail to timely submit requested medical certifications.

Employees requesting leave because of their own, or a covered relation's, serious health condition, or to care for a covered servicemember, must supply medical certification supporting the need for such leave from their health care provider or, if applicable, the health care provider of their covered family or service member. If employees provide at least 30 days notice of medical leave, they should submit the medical certification before leave begins.

Certifications Supporting Need for Military Family Leave: Certifications Supporting Need for Military Family Leave:

Upon request, the first time employees seek leave due to qualifying exigencies arising out of the active duty or call to active duty status of a covered military member, the Company may require employees to provide: \(1\) a copy of the covered military member's active duty orders or other documentation issued by the military indicating the covered military member is on active duty or call to active duty status and the dates of the covered military member's active duty service; and \(2\) a certification from the employee setting forth information concerning the nature of the qualifying exigency for which leave is requested. Employees shall provide a copy of new active duty orders or other documentation issued by the military for leaves arising out of qualifying exigencies arising out of a different active duty or call to active duty status of the same or a different covered military member.

When leave is taken to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness, 3BLADES LLC may require employees to obtain certifications completed by an authorized health care provider of the covered servicemember.

Substitution of Paid Leave for Unpaid FMLA Leave: Substitution of Paid Leave for Unpaid FMLA Leave:

Employees must use any accrued paid time while taking unpaid FMLA leave. The substitution of paid time for unpaid FMLA leave time does not extend the length of FMLA leaves; the paid time will run concurrently with an employee's FMLA entitlement.

Leaves of absence taken in connection with a disability leave plan or workers'

Page 30 of 45

compensation injury/illness shall run concurrently with any FMLA leave entitlement.

Coordination of FMLA Leave with Other Leave Policies: Coordination of FMLA Leave with Other Leave Policies:

The FMLA does not affect any federal, state or local law prohibiting discrimination, or supersede any State or local law which provides greater family or medical leave rights. For additional information concerning leave entitlements and obligations that might arise when FMLA leave is either not available or exhausted, please contact the Human Resources Representative.

7.Timekeeping & Payroll 7.Timekeeping & Payroll

7.1 7.1 Attendance & Punctuality Attendance & Punctuality

Absenteeism and tardiness place an undue burden on other employees and on the Company. 3BLADES LLC expects regular attendance and punctuality from all employees. This means being in the workplace, ready to work, at your scheduled start time each day and completing your entire shift. Employees are also expected to return from scheduled meal and break periods on time.

All time off must be requested in writing, in advance, as outlined in the Company’s Paid Time Off \(PTO\) policy. If an employee is unexpectedly unable to report for work for any reason, he or she must directly notify their supervisor as early as possible, and preferably prior to their scheduled starting time. It is not acceptable to leave a voicemail message with a supervisor, except in extreme emergencies. In cases that warrant leaving a voicemail message or when an employee’s direct supervisor is unavailable, a follow-up call must be made later that day.

If an illness or emergency occurs during work hours, employees should notify their supervisor as soon as possible.

Employees, who are going to be absent for more than one day, should contact their supervisor on each day of their absence. 3BLADES LLC reserves the right to ask for a physician's statement in the event of a long-term illness \(three consecutive days\), or multiple illnesses or injuries.

If an employee fails to notify their supervisor after three consecutive days of absence, 3BLADES LLC will presume that the employee has voluntarily resigned. 3BLADES LLC will review any extenuating circumstances that may have prevented him or her from calling in before the employee is removed from payroll.

Should undue or recurrent absence and tardiness become apparent, the employee will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

This policy is not intended to restrict an employee’s right to discuss, or act together to improve, wages, benefits and working conditions with co-workers or in any way restrict employees’ rights under the National Labor Relations Act.
